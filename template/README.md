This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Dapp](https://github.com/chase-manning/cra-template-dapp) template.

## About

This app is a boilerplate template to be used for creating EVM Dapps! :tada:
It will require modification to fit the needs of your Dapp, but hopefully will serve as a good starting point to get you up and running quicker.  
An example Dapp is included for converting ETH to WETH, this is to show how you can use the boilerplate to make contract interractions.

## Get started

Before this Dapp is production ready, you will need to make a few changes!  
First, go to `src/App.tsx` and update the `readOnlyUrls` with your own Infura URL (You can get one [here](https://infura.io/)).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
